# Spotify Web App ðŸŽ¶ 
* Login to your Spotify Account and get a custom experience using my unique Spotify App.
* This UI was designed by yours truly and was built using Vite + React + TS, and Tailwind CSS (some Daisy UI components too!)
* The server was built using Node JS + Express and the following API's listed below ðŸ‘‡ 

## API Documentation:

* Spotify Official API: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/

## Notes:

* I have also converted all the JS to TS.
